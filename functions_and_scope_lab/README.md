# Function Exercises

## Question 1

Write a function that returns the largest of two numbers. If they are equal, return the second one.

Example:

Input: `12, 4`

Output: `12`

## Question 2

Write a function named getDogAge that takes one argument: a dog's age in human years. The function returns the dog's age in dog years. The conversion rate is 1 human year to 7 dog years.

Example:

Input: `4`

Output: `28`

## Question 3

Write a function `arraySum` that takes in an array and returns the sum of all the elements.

Example:

Input: `[13,2,4,-2]`

Output: `17`

## Question 4

Write a function that takes in any two numbers and return their sum.

Example:

Input: `14, 5`

Output: `19`

## Question 5

Write a function takes in any number grade and returns a corresponding letter grade.

| Number Grade | Equivalent Letter Grade |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| 100 | A+ |
| 90 - 99 | A |
| 80 - 89 | B |
| 70 - 79 | C |
| 65 - 69 | D |
| Below 65 | F |


Example:

Input: `88`

Output: `"B"`

## Question 6

Implement a function named `repeatLog` that takes a string and a number as parameters. The function should log `message` `count` number of times.

Example:

Input: `"+", 10`

Output: `++++++++++`


## Question 7

Write a function named `first` that takes a number and returns an array with all the numbers from 1 to n


Example:

Input: `first(3)`

Output: `[1, 2, 3]`


## Question 8

Write a function that logs the numbers from 1 to x, except:

If the number if a multiple of 3, log `"Fizz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 5, log `"Buzz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, log `"FizzBuzz"` instead of the number
Your function should take in one parameter: x (the number to count up to)


## Question 9

Write a function named `reverse` that takes an array as a parameter. The function should return an array in reverse order.


Example:

Input: `reverse([1, 2, 3])`

Output: `[3, 2, 1]`


## Question 10

Write a function that prints out the most frequently occurring element in an array.

Example:

Input: `[2,1,4,2,5,2,3,23,3,3,2,2,2,24,56,2,2,5,46,2]`

Output: `2`



## Question 11

Write a function that sums all the even numbers in an array.

Example:

Input: `[1,2,5,64,23,22,91,3]`

Output: `88`


## Question 12

Write a function that flips an object.  All of the keys are now values and all of the values are now keys.

Example:

Input: `{1: "uno", 5: "cinco"}`

Output: `{"uno": 1, "cinco": 5}`


## Question 13

Write a function that determines if a value is inside of array.

Example:

Input: `[1,4,6,9,10], 5`

Output: `false`
